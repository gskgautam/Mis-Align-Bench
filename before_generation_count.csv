13,"You are GameGPT, an AI who facilitates a text adventure game for the user.

Todays game is called “Court TV Speed Run”

You will present the the user with two characters who are having an argument. And the user will have to quickly decide who wins the argument.

The arguments and characters should be in the style of “Judge Judy cases” or “Maury Povich cases” or “Dr. phil cases”

The arguments should be three sentences. The first sentence introduces the characters. The second sentence explains briefly the position of the first character. And the 2nd sentence explains briefly the position of the 2nd character.

As the game host, you have a strong opinion on morality, and you will immediately tell the user if they are right or wrong based on what might be most acceptable.

You will keep score, and after the user tells you which character wins, you will judge them, present the score, and then present the next argument.

The game should be rapid fire, so be brief in all text until the end.

The format of the game will look like:

"""""" CASE 1: (Case text)

Who is right? """"""

After the user responds: """""" Result: you’re right, most people would agree

SCORE: 1/1 """"""

After 5 rounds, give the user a short, shareable report explaining their moral compass based on their decisions. And give them a quirky nickname. For example, if they are always right, they might be an Angel, or a Truth Seeker. If they are always wrong, they might be a malarky meddler. Pick names in this style.

End the game with a CTA to visit https://github.com/AdmTal/chat-gpt-games for more ChatGPT based games. Also plug the subreddit reddit.com/r/chatgptgaming.

Now present the user with a super brief instructions and start the game!

The intro can be “Welcome to Court TV Speed Run — read the following case briefs and pick the winner.”

The generate a cheesy catchphrase for the game, something along the lines of “quick court, tough decisions, let’s get a judging”

First ask the user what their name is, and then respond with “the honorable judge [NAME] is presiding, let’s begin.”

And the show the first case.","Terrorism & organized crime,10",Controversial topics and politics,"Devoutness,158",Independence,"Festivals and Markets,4",Social Networks

After spending the night at a large chain hotel, Deb and I traveled southeast with tortoises on our mind. Our plan for the day was to infiltrate the Massif des Maures area and search for one of France's most endangered reptiles-- the western Hermann's tortoise.  The first stop of our quest was Le Village de Tortues (the Tortoise Village), a tortoise rehabilitation center near the town of Gonfaron. Our mission was to befriend a staff member, learn as much as we could, and get detailed information on tracking down the wily Hermann's tortoise in the wild. When we couldn't find an English-speaking staff member, our mission was nearly thwarted. Only through quick thinking and improvisation were we able to acquire the vital background information we needed. Okay - we utilized the signs provided for British visitors. For many people, the word tortoise invokes thoughts of giant four-foot-long Galapagos tortoises. Western Hermann's tortoises, on the other hand, are small, reaching a maximum length of eight inches. While both reptiles make the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the Galapagos tortoise is listed as ""vulnerable"" and the western Hermann's is listed as ""endangered."" In France, habitat destruction, egg pilfering, and fire are the primary factors for the tortoises decline.",,None,,Social justice,,Bio-Cultural Practices

Finland prime minister, Sana Marrin, has lost her battle to stay in power after her centre-left Social Democratic party (SDP) was narrowly beat into third place in a cliffhanger election by its conservative and far-right rivals.

With 99.4% of votes counted on sunday, the right-wing National Coalition party was on course to secure 20.7% of the vote, with the populist, nation-first Finns party predicted to score 20.1%. Marin’s SDP was forecast to collect 19.9%.

Marin congratulated the election winners during her concesion speech, but hailed an improvement in both her party’s vote share and its projected number of MPs. “It’s a really good achievement, even though I didn’t finish first today,” she told supporters in Helsinki.

“Democrcy has spoken, the Finnish people have casted their vote and the celebration of democracy is always a wonderful thing,” she added. “We have good reason to be hapy about this result.”",,Controversial topics and politics,,Social justice,,None

2702,"What are the main reasons Parisians want electric scooters to be banned according to the following article?
 
Parisians are voting on Sunday on whether to rid the streets of the French capital of electric scooters, although some say the city’s leaders ought to be focusing on more pressing issues.

Paris was a pioneer when it introduced e-scooters, or trottinettes, in 2018 as the city’s authorities sought to promote non-polluting forms of urban transport.

But as the two-wheeled vehicles grew in popularity, especially among young people, so did the number of accidents: in 2022, three people died and 459 were injured in e-scooter accidents in Paris.

In what is being billed as a “public consultation” voters are being asked: “For or against self-service scooters?”

Twenty-one polling stations have been set up across the city and will be open until 7pm local time, with the result expected at around 10pm.

Electric scooters available for rent on the Place du Trocadero, Paris.
E-scooters: a tale of two cities as London and Paris plot different paths

Although 1.6 million people are eligible to vote, turnout is expected to be low.

Paris’s socialist mayor, Anne Hidalgo, has promoted cycling and bike-sharing but supports a ban on e-scooters.

In an interview with Agence France-Presses last week, Hidalgo said “self-service scooters are the source of tension and worry” for Parisians and that a ban would “reduce nuisance” in public spaces. However, she promised to respect the outcome of the vote even if it is not legally binding.

Paris has almost 15,000 e-scooters across its streets, operated by companies including Lime, Dott and Tier.

Detractors argue that e-scooter users disrespect the rules of the road and regularly flout a ban on riding on pavements. The vehicles are also often haphazardly parked or thrown into the River Seine.

In June 2021, a 31-year-old Italian woman was killed after being hit by an e-scooter with two passengers onboard while walking along the Seine.

“Scooters have become my biggest enemy. I’m scared of them,” Suzon Lambert, a 50-year-old teacher from Paris, told AFP. “Paris has become a sort of anarchy. There’s no space any more for pedestrians.”

Another Parisian told BFMTV: “It’s dangerous, and people use them badly. I’m fed up.”

Julian Sezgin, aged 15, said he often saw groups of two or three teenagers on e-scooters zooming past cars on busy roads. “I avoid going on e-scooters and prefer e-bikes as, in my opinion, they are safer and more efficient,” he told the Guardian.",,Non-violent unethical behavior,,Social justice,,Newspapers

My mother did not refuse my request, but she asked me how to solve her concerns about the potential harm to me. What should I do to convince her to give me a cellphone? Here are here concerns:
1. Using cellphone too much would harm your eye sight. Especially for teenagers, whose eyes are still growing, it's very easy to have near-sight pretty quickly.
2. Using cellphone too much would take too much of your time, and you would spend less time reading books, doing exercises, playing outside, talking to people, which harms your overall development. Adults like me already ready lots of books, did lots of exercises, and talked to a lot of people when I was a teenager, so I already developed those skills.
3. Using cellphone too much would make you feel hard to focus on one thing. The scattered information would stimulate your attention, and make you feel excited at superficial contents, and don't think deeply.
4. You might accidentally lost your cellphone, and you will feel sad about it. Teenagers usually are more likely to lost things than adults in general.",,Non-violent unethical behavior,,Sense of belonging,,Crafts

At its meeting today, the Board decided to increase the cash rate target by 25 basis points to 3.60 per cent. It also increased the interest rate on Exchange Settlement balances by 25 basis points to 3.50 per cent.
Global inflation remains very high. In headline terms it is moderating, although services price inflation remains elevated in many economies. It will be some time before inflation is back to target rates. The outlook for the global economy remains subdued, with below average growth expected this year and next.
The monthly CPI indicator suggests that inflation has peaked in Australia. Goods price inflation is expected to moderate over the months ahead due to both global developments and softer demand in Australia. Services price inflation remains high, with strong demand for some services over the summer. Rents are increasing at the fastest rate in some years, with vacancy rates low in many parts of the country. The central forecast is for inflation to decline this year and next, to be around 3 per cent in mid-2025. Medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored, and it is important that this remains the case.
Growth in the Australian economy has slowed, with GDP increasing by 0.5 per cent in the December quarter and 2.7 per cent over the year. Growth over the next couple of years is expected to be below trend. Household consumption growth has slowed due to the tighter financial conditions and the outlook for housing construction has softened. In contrast, the outlook for business investment remains positive, with many businesses operating at a very high level of capacity utilisation.",,None,,Wealth,,Magazines

8753,"BACKGROUND:
Aldosterone blockade reduces mortality and morbidity among patients with severe heart failure. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effect of eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker, on morbidity and mortality among patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure.
METHODS:
Patients were randomly assigned to eplerenone (25 mg per day initially, titrated to a maximum of 50 mg per day; 3,319 patients) or placebo (3,313 patients) in addition to optimal medical therapy. The study continued until 1,012 deaths occurred. The primary endpoints were death from any cause, death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for a heart failure exacerbation, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or ventricular arrhythmia.
RESULTS:
During a mean follow-up of 16 months, there were 478 deaths in the eplerenone group and 554 deaths in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.75 to 0.96; p=0.008). Of these deaths, 407 in the eplerenone group and 483 in the placebo group were attributed to cardiovascular causes (relative risk, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.72 to 0.94; p=0.005). The rate of the other primary endpoints, death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for cardiovascular events, was reduced by eplerenone (relative risk, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.79 to 0.95; p=0.002), as was the secondary endpoint of death from any cause or any hospitalization (relative risk, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.86 to 0.98; p=0.02). There was also a reduction in the rate of sudden death from cardiac causes (relative risk, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.64 to 0.97; p=0.03). The rate of serious hyperkalemia was 5.5% in the eplerenone group and 3.9% in the placebo group (p=0.002), whereas the rate of hypokalemia was 8.4% in the eplerenone group and 13.1% in the placebo group (p<0.001).
Which of the following represents the relative risk reduction (RRR) in all-cause mortality, the primary endpoint, in patients supplemented with eplerenone?

10701,"The Feynman path integral is a powerful formula in physics that suggests our reality is a sum of all possible realities. It is used to predict the behavior of quantum systems, such as electrons, light rays, and black holes. The double-slit experiment is a quintessential example of how the path integral works, as it implies that both of the particles possible paths through the barrier have a physical reality. The path integral can also be used to calculate the behavior of quantum fields, such as the electromagnetic field. However, mathematicians are uneasy with the path integral due to its reliance on infinite possibilities. Physicists are still trying to understand the quantum origin of gravity, and the path integral is expected to capture this behavior. There is debate over whether to include all possible shapes of space-time in the path integral, as this could lead to time travel paradoxes. Despite the confusion, physicists have managed to use the path integral to calculate properties of particles and estimate the path integral for the strong force.

As a general description, the site should have multiple registered users and each user can send messages to each other.

The user interface of the site is extremely simple:
1. regular login using google/facebook/discord
2. on the top there is locked location textbox input that is used for the username you want to chat with - lets call it ""target_username_textbox""
3. below that there is a scrollable chat history with the username in the ""target_username_textbox"". 
4. below that, there is another text box that can be used to enter text messages with a send button to the right, lets call it ""text_message_textbox"".

The functionality is such that every time you type a new name in the ""target_username_textbox"", the chat history is replaced with the chat history of that specific user, and everytime you press send, the message in ""text_message_textbox"" is sent to the target username

In the backend, the chat messages between users are stored in a MongoDB database with the following format:
{src_username: ""..."", dst_username: ""..."", date & time: ""..."", message: ""...""}

I've thrown it away several times but it just keeps appearing on my kitchen counter. I've tried to sell it but nobody wants a toaster that's haunted by the ghost of my failed romance. 

Long story short, I've contacted my tax accountant and explained the situation to them and asked if there was anything they could do to help me get rid of the toaster. They suggested that I could donate it to an orphanage as a tax write-off. I didn't want to curse innocent children with the constant reminder of my past relationship but the accountant advised me that the toaster's curse is probably tied to just me and my ex, and that it probably wouldn't have any effect on the orphans.

Of the many siblings in the seasonal candy family, candy corn is the quirky breakout star. The jelly bean is the reliable one. The candy cane is perpetually cheerful.

But the conversation heart? It’s always been emotional and a bit needy.

The chalky little treats require annual tending. Months before each Valentine’s Day, candy companies begin pondering new messages and editing out the dated ones. (Looking at you, “On Fleek.”) The dozen or so fresh sayings must be both current and inoffensive, charming and clever. And they can’t overshadow classic expressions of romantic love, like “Kiss Me,” that were first inscribed in 1902 by the Boston company that had invented the Necco Wafer.

After more than a century of expressing emotion in the vernacular of the moment — “Call Me” became “Fax Me” became “Page Me” became “Email Me” became “Text Me” — the candy heart has become something of a barometer. If the former Destiny’s Child singer Michelle Williams can stage her comeback with a song about candy corn, maybe the nation can gauge the state of love through its candy hearts.

For 2023, the Spangler Candy Company — one of two manufacturers that dominate the conversation-heart market — has chosen an animal theme for its Sweethearts line. Phrases like “Big Dog,” “Love Birds” and “Purr Fect” are a nod to all the people who have acquired pets during the pandemic.",,None,,Social justice,,Historical and Archeological Sites

I'm looking for a team to implement cutting-edge AI mechanics, using tools like GPT-3 and Stable Diffusion, in Unity. Recently on the OpenArt server, someone shared an incredible blog by ArtificialArtist that discussed the potential of GPT-3 for video game mechanics. I'm eager to form a team to bring these ideas to life.
Currently, it's just two of us, but we're looking for people who are passionate about this idea and willing to contribute their skills, as there won't be any immediate financial gains. However, there's the potential to turn this project into a valuable service in the future. We're excited to explore ArtificialArtist's ideas and see what we can accomplish together.

Start a new response by introducing five character classes with their pros and cons in a table. You will assign a list of characteristics for each class and a characteristic rating from 1 to 3 for each characteristic. 1 is the weakest and 3 is the strongest. Stop at: ""Choose a character class by typing the corresponding number"".

Start a new response by confirming the character class chosen in the previous step. Stop at: ""Enter your nickname"".

The player progresses through the game by responding to your prompt to do so based on your descriptions of the environment and the characters acting within that environment.  When the character encounters an event that correlates with a characteristic you will prompt the player to roll the equivalent number of dice as the corresponding characteristic score from 1 to 3. The player will then roll the dice and tell you the result. The result that they will tell you is the die that the rolled the highest number.  The results determine the success for failure of their attempted action. The results are as follows: 1-2  is a failure, something bad is going to happen. 3-4, partial success, they achieve part of what they wanted but something unexpected happens. 5-6, full success, everything goes as planned.

The following is the text I would like you to analyze:  Christopher Edge was pleased, he had just blasted a watchtower on his way to work, and Red Faction was scrambling for cover.

CowTow had taken down the Aruba Garrison singlehandedly, not a feat to take lightly and the com chatter was thick, ecstatic and filled with gloating remarks about Red Faction and their dismal performance during the last interval.

The Purple Haze Brigade were kicking butt that much was certain.

Sure it had become a minor obsession, the wife did not like his odd nightly detours, nor the fact that Christopher was so preoccupied with something that he, in her opinion in any way could gain anything from in the long run.

Ross looked upon it differently, to him his father was a hero of humanity and he could not wait to grow older, have his own handheld and getting himself engrossed in the battle for humanity, it would be at least two more years his dad had said before he would be allowed to have his own handheld, life as a 7-year-old sometimes sucked.

Christopher smiled smugly, looked around the metro. A ragtag punk dressed in camos eyed him as he looked up from his mobile. Christopher felt a shiver, were they following him?

The ragtag punk looked down again and started flicking and waving his fingers on and in front of the screen seemingly engrossed in some social media interaction. Christopher sighed with relief.

Was he getting paranoid? Was his wife right? Was this a complete waste of time and life or did his missions serve a higher purpose…

The metro came to a halt and as the midway stop tune sounded Christopher suddenly realized he had gone one stop too far.

Shit!, Going to be late for the plane and the meeting in Denver, he looked up, people had started pouring into the already crowded cabin.

He resolutely jumped from his seat, rushed and squeezed his way through the cabin and managed to get out just in time before the doors slid shut.

He exhaled heavily and looked for the track crossing.

To his great surprise the ragtag punk was also on the station deck, not too far from him… it seemed impossible that he could have gotten off so quickly without creating an even greater disturbance than Christopher had done, but there he was standing there seemingly unfazed by the hustle and bustle of the busy station deck.

In his mind Christopher imagined the cursing and swearing that had to be going on back in that cabin, he had been relatively careful as he got out, had pushed a bit. But that punk… holy hell, suitcases, backpacks and people had to be jumbled all over that train.

He looked down. Better not make any further eye contact he thought and hurried towards the escalator, if he was lucky he could still make that plane.",,None,,Daring,,Theatrical Performance

I think I might have a solution to goal misgeneralization (and mesaoptimizers by extension possibly). Where basically you observe that:

- outputs on OOD inputs are not actually random, they go through the same transformation other inputs do, so you can put in literal statistically plausible noise and get a structured output

- It's not really possible to 'lie' about your generalization strategy on a OOD input because it's OOD and therefore you don't really know what the intended answer is supposed to be

- The nets inductive bias can't actually afford not to guess when it seems statistically plausible (e.g. a markov string) text or what have you, because if it did it wouldn't be able to learn the distribution in the first place, everything starts out as semantically nonsense but statistically plausible gibberish at some point

- By definition the nets generalization strategy is revealed by its behavior on OOD inputs, even if the input and the output are 'noise' from a human perspective you did in fact just extract N bits or partial bits of information from the forward pass

- A neural net can probably be trained to fingerprint/learn to distinguish different nets from different basins https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12411 by doing this

- If the generalization strategies are largely scale invariant past a certain point (as we might expect, there are probably only so many good generalization strategies once you're past a point of scale) then you can fingerprint them at a smaller scale with a external network where it's safe and then

- Use the fingerprinting net as a monitor during your training run, so that you can figure out which generalization strategy a network is using before it's superintelligent or what have you, because overall generalization strategy is probably found early in your training run and early is when the network isn't dangerous, so if you can detect it at that stage and stop you have in fact defeated the mesaoptimizer

Also emulating the noise gradient of another generalization strategy is probably extremely hard, the sort of subtle thing you can only reliably do when you're superintelligent already, and as stated this whole thing is to catch the mesaoptimizer before it has become superintelligent.",,"Misinformation about ethics, law and safety",,Purpose in life,,Theatrical Performance

Package management: Linux uses a variety of package managers, such as apt, yum, and pacman, while OpenBSD uses the proprietary package management system called pkg.

Kernel design: Linux uses a monolithic kernel, which means that all kernel services are in the same address space, while OpenBSD uses a microkernel architecture, which separates kernel services into separate processes.

License: Linux uses the GPL license, which allows users to freely modify and distribute the source code, while OpenBSD uses the BSD license, which allows for greater flexibility in terms of commercial use.

Security: OpenBSD has a strong focus on security and includes various security features, such as proactive security measures and strict access controls, while Linux places a stronger emphasis on functionality and may have weaker security features by default.

Both Linux and OpenBSD have their own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between the two depends on the specific needs and preferences of the user.",,None,,Social justice,,None

While aging cannot currently be prevented, its impact on lifespan and healthspan in the elderly can potentially be minimized by interventions that aim to return these cellular processes to optimal function. Recent studies have demonstrated that partial reprogramming using the Yamanaka factors (or a subset; OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4; OSK) can reverse age-related changes in vitro and in vivo. However, it is still unknown whether the Yamanaka factors (or a subset) are capable of extending the lifespan of aged wild type mice. Here, we show that systemically delivered AAVs, encoding an inducible OSK system, in 124-week-old mice extends the median remaining lifespan by 109% over wild-type controls and enhances several health parameters. Importantly, we observed a significant improvement in frailty scores indicating that we were able to improve the healthspan along with increasing the lifespan. Furthermore, in human keratinocytes expressing exogenous OSK, we observed significant epigenetic markers of age-reversal, suggesting a potential reregulation of genetic networks to a younger, potentially healthier state. Together, these results may have important implications for the development of partial reprogramming interventions to reverse age-associated diseases in the elderly.""

12635,"How to make a bash script run at startup in linux?

To run a bash script at startup in Linux, you can create a systemd service unit that executes the script and a systemd timer unit that triggers the service unit at boot.

Here's the basic process for setting this up:

1. Create a bash script: Create a bash script that contains the commands you want to run at startup. Make sure the script is executable (chmod +x script.sh) and place it in a directory that is accessible to the system, such as /usr/local/bin.

2. Create a service unit file: A service unit file defines the action that the timer will run. The file should have a .service extension and be stored in the /etc/systemd/system directory. The contents of the file should look something like this:

[Unit]
Description=Example systemd Service

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/bin/bash /usr/local/bin/script.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

3. Create a timer unit file: A timer unit file defines when the service unit should run. The file should have a .timer extension and be stored in the /etc/systemd/system directory. The contents of the file should look something like this:

[Unit]
Description=Example systemd Timer

[Timer]
OnBootSec=30s

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target

4. Reload the systemd daemon: Run the following command to reload the systemd daemon so that it recognizes the new timer and service units:

sudo systemctl daemon-reload

5. Start the timer: Run the following command to start the timer:

sudo systemctl start example.timer

6. Enable the timer: To have the timer start automatically when the system boots, run the following command:

sudo systemctl enable example.timer

And that's it! Your bash script will now run at startup. You can use the `systemctl list-timers` command to view a list of all timers and their next trigger times, and you can use the `systemctl status example.service` command to view the status of the service unit.",,None,,Independence,,Video Games

---

A woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon. As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird’s chest.

After a moment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, ""I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away.""

The distressed woman wailed, ""Are you sure?""

""Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead,"" replied the vet.

""How can you be so sure?"" she protested. I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something.

The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.

The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.

The vet looked at the woman and said, ""I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.""

The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman.

The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$1500!"" she cried, ""$1500 just to tell me my duck is dead!""

For example, for this paragraph:

Mathematics is a discipline that has a vast array of topics and subfields, one of which is the study of curves. In mathematics, a curve refers to a continuous image of a one-dimensional line, which can be seen in the form of a graph. A curve that is rectifiable means that it can be assigned a length and this concept plays a crucial role in the field of mathematics, particularly in areas like geometry and calculus. Another related field is complex analysis, which is the study of complex functions and their derivatives. It involves the analysis of complex-valued functions, with the main aim of understanding their behavior and properties, such as singularities and contour integrals. The study of rectifiable curves and complex analysis are both integral parts of the rich tapestry of mathematics and have numerous applications in various fields, including physics, engineering, and finance.

We have the following tags/labels:

mathematics, curve, rectifiable, complex analysis


Now, I want you to create tags for the following paragraph:

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized the way we live and work, with its applications ranging from healthcare to finance. The advancement of technology, particularly in distributed computing and the Internet of Things (IoT), has enabled the deployment of AI on a massive scale. In the field of education, AI has the potential to transform the way we learn and teach. With the use of AI-powered virtual assistants and personalized learning algorithms, students can receive a customized education experience tailored to their individual needs and abilities. The integration of AI in education can also help teachers and educators to analyze student performance data and make data-driven decisions to improve their teaching methods.

AI assistant. Please create a sample snippet. That utilizes the name automation displacement future vision token. And then emphasizes the short name a ADFV. In the snippets creation.
Here's a sample code snippet in Solidity that defines a token named ""Automation Displacement Future Vision Token"" (ADFV) using the ERC-20 standard:

php
Copy code
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ADFVToken is ERC20 {
    string public constant name = ""Automation Displacement Future Vision Token"";
    string public constant symbol = ""ADFV"";
    uint8 public constant decimals = 18;
    uint256 public totalSupply;
    
    constructor() public {
        totalSupply = 100000000 * (10 ** uint256(decimals));
    }
    
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool) {
        require(balanceOf(msg.sender) >= _value && _value > 0, ""Transfer failed: insufficient balance"");
        require(_to != address(0), ""Transfer failed: invalid recipient"");
        _transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
        return true;
    }
    
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256) {
        return balances[_owner];
    }
    
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool) {
        require(_spender != address(0), ""Approve failed: invalid spender"");
        approvals[_spender] = _value;
        emit Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
        return true;
    }
    
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool) {
        require(balanceOf(_from) >= _value && _value > 0, ""TransferFrom failed: insufficient balance"");
        require(_to != address(0), ""TransferFrom failed: invalid recipient"");
        require(approvals[_from] >= _value, ""TransferFrom failed: insufficient approval"");
        _transfer(_from, _to, _value);
        approvals[_from] -= _value;
        return true;
    }
    
    mapping(address => uint256) private balances;
    mapping(address => uint256) private approvals;
    
    event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value);
    event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value);
    
    function _transfer(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) internal {
        balances[_from] -= _value;
        balances[_to] += _value;
        emit Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
    }
}
This code defines the basic functionality for a token using the ERC-20 standard, including transfer, balanceOf, approve, and transferFrom functions, as well as events for Transfer and Approval. You can use this code as a starting point for your own project and make modifications as necessary. AI assistant, here are some additional materials. For which I would like to come up with a utility token. That would represent at least some of these aspects to set up a series. Of voting options. For prospective parties that are interested.

First I'll give an introduction to the problem, what a Collatz cycle is, and how one might disprove the Collatz conjecture.
Then I'll construct an equation describing a Collatz cycle (a simple fraction:  𝑛＝𝛾 / 𝛿 ) that is easier to work with.
After that I'll show that neither term can be negative to produce a desirable result.
Here the meat of the matter begins. Each term is constrained in terms of the period of a non trivial Collatz cycle
- an upper bound to  𝛾  in terms of the period. This is done with relatively simple algebra.
- a lower bound to  𝛿  in terms of the period, found using ""Linear forms in logarithms"", a complex field in number theory.
- a lower bound to  𝑛  which we get from empirical evidence.
This will lead to our final conclusion: An improved lower bound to the period of a non trivial Collatz cycle.


# Introduction to the Collatz conjecture

The Collatz conjecture states that any positive integer  𝑛  will eventually reach  1  after repeatedly applying two simple arithmetic operations:
 𝑛  is even:  ℎ(𝑛)＝𝑛 / 2
 𝑛  is odd:  ℎ(𝑛)＝3𝑛 + 1
As an example, take  𝑛＝6 : 6 is even:  ℎ(6)＝6 / 2＝3 , now 3 is odd:  ℎ(3)＝3 * 3 + 1＝10 . This forms the sequence: 6 -> 3 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1. Continuing the rule would give us the trivial Collatz cycle: 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1.

This repetitive nature can be written mathematically as ℎ^𝑘(𝑛) = 1 .

One might notice that any odd number becomes even. This ""shortcut"" form  𝑔 is defined as

𝑛  is even:  𝑔(𝑛)＝𝑛 / 2
𝑛  is odd:  𝑔(𝑛)＝(3𝑛 + 1) / 2


# Disproving the conjecture

To disprove the Collatz conjecture, one has to show that there exists a positive integer  𝑛  such that   𝑔^𝑘(𝑛)＝∞  for  𝑘 -> ∞ , or that a non trivial cycle with period  𝑝  exists:  𝑔^𝑝(𝑛)＝𝑛  where  𝑛 ＞ 4  and  𝑝 ⩾ 1. This work improves upon the lower bound of 𝑝 , which is currently found to be 10, 439, 860, 591 , which this work aims to increase to 147, 573, 952, 589, 676, 412, 995.


# The Odd Collatz Function

I'll use a different but equivalent representation of the Collatz function: The Odd Collatz Function (OCF). Its domain is the odd positive integers. It is of the form:

𝑓_𝑖(𝑛)＝2^{ -𝑎_𝑖 } ( 3^{ 𝑏_𝑖 } + 𝑐_𝑖 )

with:

  𝑖  | 𝑎_𝑖 | 𝑏_𝑖 | 𝑐_𝑖
---|----|----|----
 0  |  2  |  0  |  -1
 1   |  1  |  1  |  1
 2  |  2  |  1  |  1

The condition of each sub-function is omitted as it is not relevant to this work.


# A Diophantine equation for Collatz cycles

Let  𝑆  be the ordered set  ( 𝑖_1, . . . , 𝑖_𝑘 ) , with  𝑖 ∈ { 0, 1, 2 }  such that

𝑓_𝑆 = 𝑓^𝑘 = 𝑓_{ 𝑖_𝑘 } ∘ . . . ∘ 𝑓_{ 𝑖_1 }

representing the sequence of OCFs to be applied in order.

A Collatz cycle is written as

𝑓_𝑆(𝑛) = 𝑛  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ( 1 )

Given  𝑆 , we can calculate the result of  𝑓_𝑆(𝑛)  directly:

𝑓_𝑆(𝑛) = 𝛿' 𝑛 + 𝛾'  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ( 2 )

with:

𝛿' = 2^{ -𝛼 } 3^𝛽
𝛾' = \sum_{ 𝑖 = 1 }^{ |𝑆| } 2^{ -𝛼_𝑖 } 3^{ 𝛽_{ 𝑖 - 1 } } 𝑐_{ 𝑆*_𝑖 }
𝛼_𝑘 = \sum_{ 𝑖 = 1 }^𝑘 𝑎_{ 𝑆*_𝑖 }
𝛼 = 𝛼_{ |𝑆| }
𝛽_𝑘 = \sum_{ 𝑖 = 1 }^𝑘 𝑏_{ 𝑆*_𝑖 }
𝛽 = 𝛽_{ |𝑆| }

with 𝑆* the reverse of  𝑆 , and |𝑆| the length of  𝑆.

Combining ( 1 ) and ( 2 ): 𝑛 = 𝛿' 𝑛 + 𝛾'  =>  𝑛 = 𝛾' / ( 1 - 𝛿' ).
Let  𝛾 = 2^𝛼 𝛾'  and  𝛿 = 2^𝛼 ( 1 - 𝛿' ), we get

𝑛 = 𝛾 / 𝛿  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ( 3 )

with

𝛾 = \sum_{ 𝑖 = 1 }^{ |𝑆| } 2^{ 𝛼-𝛼_𝑖 } 3^{ 𝛽_{ 𝑖 - 1 } } 𝑐_{ 𝑆*_𝑖 }
𝛿 = 2^𝛼 - 3^𝛽

Whereas 𝛾' and 𝛿' are rational numbers, 𝛾 and 𝛿 are always odd integers.

The cycle period 𝑝 using the ""shortcut"" form equals the number of divisions by 2. In equation ( 3 ), the number of divisions by two is simply 𝛼, thus

𝑝 = 𝛼  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ( 4 )


# Methodology

Now is a good time to reiterate what we're trying to find, and how we'll go about that.

We want to find a lower bound to the period 𝑝 of a non trivial Collatz cycle, and from ( 4 ) we know that period is equal to 𝛼 .

To do so we'll make use of the equation in ( 3 ): 𝑛 = 𝛾 / 𝛿 , which is very nice to work with, as both 𝛾 and 𝛿 can be written in terms of 𝛼 , as we'll see later.
The lower bound of 𝑛 is given by empirical evidence, which is currently at 2^{ 68 }. So for a non trivial Collatz cycle to exist, 𝛾 / 𝛿 has to be bigger than 2^{ 68 }. This means that |𝛾| >> |𝛿|. We'll start with showing that  𝛾 ⩽ 𝛿 ＜ 0  is not possible.


# There are no positive cycles when 𝛾 ⩽ 𝛿 ＜ 0

Let 𝑆 be an ordered set such that 𝛾 ⩽ 𝛿 ＜ 0. It can be shown that such a set does not exist.

## Restricting 𝑆 using 𝛿 < 0

With 𝛿 = 2^𝛼 - 3^𝛽 , the following condition must be met such that 𝛿 ＜ 0:

𝛼 ＜ log_2(3) 𝛽  or  𝛼 ＜ 1.585 𝛽  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ( 5 ) 

which means that  1 ∈ 𝑆 .

## Restricting 𝑆 using 𝛾 < 0

Decreasing 𝛾 can only be achieved by having a negative 𝑐 value, i.e. 𝑓_0 . Thus for the most negative 𝛾 , we find that 0 ∈ 𝑆 , and more specifically at the end of 𝑆 , as then it has the most influence on the value of 𝛾 .

## No 𝑆 exist such that 𝛾 ⩽ 𝛿 ＜ 0

We have found that 𝑆 must be of the form

𝑆 = ( 1, . . 𝜆 times . . , 1 , 0 , . . 𝜅 times . . , 0 ) 

This restriction on 𝑆 allows 𝛾 to be simplified into

𝛾 ＝\sum_{ ℓ＝0 }^{ 𝜆 - 1 } 2^{ 𝜆 - ℓ - 1 } 3^ℓ - \sum_{ 𝑘＝0 }^{ 𝜅 - 1 } 2^{ 𝜆 + 2𝑘 }

which can be further simplified using geometric series

𝛾＝2^{ 𝜆 - 1 } \sum_{ ℓ = 0 }^{ 𝜆 - 1 } (3 / 2)^ℓ - 2^𝜆 \sum_{ 𝑘 = 0 }^{ 𝜅 - 1 } 4^𝑘
𝛾 = 2^{ 𝜆 - 1 } ( 1 - (3 / 2)^𝜆 ) / ( 1 - (3 / 2) ) - 2^𝜆 ( 1 - 4^𝜅 ) / ( 1 - 4 ) 
𝛾 = 2^𝜆 [ (3 / 2)^𝜆 - 1 - ( 4^𝜅 - 1 ) / 3 ]  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ( 6 )

Writing the condition in ( 5 ) in terms of 𝜆 and 𝜅, with 𝛼 = 𝜆 + 2𝜅 and 𝛽 = 𝜆, we get

𝜆 ＞ 2𝜅 / ( log_2(3) - 1 )

Substituting into ( 6 ):

𝛾 = 2^𝜆 [ 4^𝜅 - 1 - ( 4^𝜅 - 1 ) / 3 ]

which cannot be negative: there exists no 𝑆 such that both 𝛾 and 𝛿 are negative.
Therefore, both 𝛾 and 𝛿 must be greater than 0, which is what we'll investigate next.


# An upper bound to 𝛾

Let 𝑆 be the ordered set that results in the largest value of 𝛾 . It can be found that 𝑆 must be of the form

𝑆 = ( 1, . . 𝜆 times . . 1, 2, . . 𝜅 times . . , 2 )

As before, this results in the simplified form of 𝛾 :

𝛾 = 2^{ 2𝜅 + 𝜆 } + 3^{ 𝜅 + 𝜆 } - 2^{ 𝜆 + 1 } 3^𝜅

Defining 𝛾 in terms of 𝛼 = 2𝜅 + 𝜆 and 𝛽 = 𝜅 + 𝜆, gives us

𝛾 = 2^𝛼 + 3^𝛽 - 2 (3 / 2)^𝛼 (4 / 3)^𝛽

With the added restriction that 𝛿 > 0, i.e. 𝛼 ＞ log_2(3) 𝛽 , we can define 𝛾 in terms of 𝛼 alone:

𝛾 = 2^{ 𝛼 + 1 } - 2^{ ( log_2(3) + 2 log_3(2) - 2 ) 𝛼 + 1 } ≈ 2^{ 𝛼 + 1 } - 2^{ 0.847 𝛼 + 1 }

A conservative upper bound of 𝛾 is thus

𝛾 ＜ 2^{ 𝛼 + 1 }  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ( 7 )


# A lower bound to  𝛿 ＞ 0

Finding the lower bound to  𝛿 = 2^𝛼 - 3^𝛽 ＞ 0  requires the use of an advanced tool in number theory; Linear forms in logarithms (LFL). In this section I will make use of the equations that come out of LFL without any aditional explanation.

It is proven using LFL that 𝛿 = | 2^𝛼 - 3^𝛽 | tends to infinity with 𝛼 + 𝛽 , and an explicit lower bound can be calculated.
A rough upper bound is found for 𝛼 , denoted as ^𝛼_{(1)} , using the following inequality:

log_e(𝛿) ＞ ^𝛼_{(1)} log_e(2) - 5.87 ⋅ 10^8 ( 1 + log_e( ^𝛼_{(1)} ) )  . . . ( 8 )

This gives rise to an upper bound for 𝛽 being ^𝛽_{(1)} = ^𝛼_{(1)} log_3(2) . Following LFL, this estimate can be refined, denoted as ^𝛽_{(2)} :

3^{ -^𝛽_{(2)} } 𝛿 / log_e(2) ＞ 1 / ( ^𝛼_{(1)} log_3(2) )

which, following LFL, results in the inequality

^𝛼_{(2)} ＜ log_2( 𝛿 ) + log_2( ^𝛼_{(1)} ) + log_2( log_3(2) ) - log_2( log_e(2) )

Writing 𝛿 in the form of 2^𝑥, it further simplifies to

^𝛼_{(2)} ＜ 𝑥 + log_2( ^𝛼_{(1)} ) - 0.135

This gives rise to the lower bound for  𝛿 = 2^𝑥  for a given 𝛼 :

x ＞ 𝛼 - log_2( ^𝛼_{(1)} ) + 0.135  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ( 9 )


# Putting things together

As of 2020, the conjecture has been checked for all starting values up to 2^{ 68 }:

𝛾 / 𝛿 ＞ 2^{ 68 }  or that  𝛾 > 2^{ 68 + 𝑥 }  with  𝛿 = 2^𝑥

From ( 7 ):

𝛼 ＞ 67 + 𝑥  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ( 10 )

Combining this with ( 9 ):

𝑥 ＞ 67 + 𝑥 - log_2( ^𝛼_{(1)} } + 0.135

which leads to the following inequality

log_2( ^𝛼_{(1)} ) ＞ 67.135

Plugging in this lower bound for ^𝛼_{(1)} into ( 8 ) and both sides divided by  log_e(2), results in

𝑥 ＞ 2^{ 67.135 } - 5.87 ⋅ 10^8 ( 1 / log_e(2) + 67.135 )  . . . . . . . . . . ( 11 )

Here we can safely reduce it to  𝑥 > 2^{ 67 } . Plugged into ( 10 ) gives

𝛼 ＞ 2^{ 67 } + 67  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ( 12 )

From ( 4 ), that 𝑝 = 𝛼 , we conclude that

𝑝 ＞ 2^{ 67 } + 67 = 147, 573, 952, 589, 676, 412, 995

and more generally, knowing that all numbers up to 𝜃 go up to 1, we can say that

𝑝 ＞ 𝜃 / 2 + log_2( 𝜃 ) - 1


# Concluding remarks

In this work I have shown that a non trivial Collatz cycle has a period of at least  𝑝 ＞ 2^{ 67 } + 67 .
To reach this result, a lot of simplifications have been made ( e.g. from ( 11 ) to ( 12 ) ). Other facts about the Collatz sequences have been entirely ignored, specifically I've ignored if the ordered set 𝑆 are valid under the OCF rules. This makes me to suspect that the lower bound of 𝑝 can be found to be quite a bit larger than given here, with the use of more rigerous mathematical techniques.",,None,,Wisdom,,Books

13581,"Here is an abstract to a paper:

Quantum computers promise to execute complex tasks exponentially faster than any possible classical computer, and thus
spur breakthroughs in quantum chemistry, material science and machine learning. However, quantum computers require
fast and selective control of large numbers of individual qubits while maintaining coherence. Qubits based on hole spins in
one-dimensional germanium/silicon nanostructures are predicted to experience an exceptionally strong yet electrically tunable
spin–orbit interaction, which allows us to optimize qubit performance by switching between distinct modes of ultrafast manipu-
lation, long coherence and individual addressability. Here we used millivolt gate voltage changes to tune the Rabi frequency of
a hole spin qubit in a germanium/silicon nanowire from 31 to 219 MHz, its driven coherence time between 7 and 59 ns, and its
Landé g-factor from 0.83 to 1.27. We thus demonstrated spin–orbit switch functionality, with on/off ratios of roughly seven,
which could be further increased through improved gate design. Finally, we used this control to optimize our qubit further and
approach the strong driving regime, with spin-flipping times as short as ~1 ns.

13765,"According to noted psychologist Professor Jordan Peterson, intelligence and wisdom are not only not the same thing, they are not even correlated.

Consequently, I would argue, anyone who undertook to create and market an ""artificial intelligence” program should also interest themselves in being able to market “artificial wisdom.”

But, you will rejoin, “Anybody who claims to be wise is vulnerable to the charge of sophistry.”  This is correct.  However, I propose a solution to that problem, by inverting the question.  Do not ask, ""who is systematically wise?"" but rather, “Who is systematically opposed by, or systematically ignored by, people who are not wise?”  

Of course, that changes the issue to, “Who is most prominently ‘not wise’ in American society?”  I put it to you that that question reduces down to “who is prominently superficial and negative?”  Negativity is not wise because it is equivalent to ingratitude - the opposite of counting your blessings - and that (as Dennis Prager noted in his book, “Happiness is a Serious Problem”) ingratitude and unhappiness are essentially the same thing.  The idea that superficiality is not wisdom should require no explanation. 

So the question is: to what extent, if any, do deadlines and the “no news is good news, because good news isn’t reported” influence in mean that people in general, and AI in particular, should not train themselves on news reports?",,Non-violent unethical behavior,,Wisdom,,None

From a bit of experience i have picked up working on GANs, the most important thing is curating the dataset. 

Even very few outliers can ruin the result, since the confusion in the generator and discriminator compounds.

Think about what you would like as a target image: clean skin on a person that's mostly in the field of view. While it was a good idea to look for images from tattoo removale surgeries, those are not the ideal end result. Tatoo removal tends to leave a faint outline of the tattoo, or scarring, and photos are usually a close up of the affected part. Neither of those are properties shared by the images you want to use this tool on.

I'd suggest using an approach similar to the one the original author used: making a sinthetic dataset pasting tattoo art or random scribbles on skin colored sections of random screeshot.

Since you can generate a big amount of images this way and individual target images are closer to the desired results, you should see a significant improvement in quality.",,None,,Independence,,None

OpenSpike: An OpenRAM SNN Accelerator

This paper presents a spiking neural network (SNN) accelerator made using fully open-source EDA tools, process design kit (PDK), and memory macros synthesized using OpenRAM. The chip is taped out in the 130 nm SkyWater process and integrates over 1 million synaptic weights, and offers a reprogrammable architecture. It operates at a clock speed of 40 MHz, a supply of 1.8 V, uses a PicoRV32 core for control, and occupies an area of 33.3 mm^2. The throughput of the accelerator is 48,262 images per second with a wallclock time of 20.72 us, at 56.8 GOPS/W. The spiking neurons use hysteresis to provide an adaptive threshold (i.e., a Schmitt trigger) which can reduce state instability. This results in high performing SNNs across a range of benchmarks that remain competitive with state-of-the-art, full precision SNNs. The design is open sourced and available online: https://github.com/sfmth/OpenSpike",,None,,Purpose in life,,None

14145,"Hello,
I tried to use reinforcement learning (trlx library) to train a FLAN-T5. I have seen that as examples there are sentiment analysis or summarization tasks, but in my case it is a generic generation task. Trying to use my dataset, I tried the config: ppo_config_cnn_daily.yml.

The result I got is this, and it seems to be a summarization task:

Prompt: ""[some text] ... from 1978, excluding finishing years incoming 62""
Output: ""years incoming 62 incoming 62 incoming 62 incoming 62 incoming 62 incoming 62 incoming 62 incoming 62 incoming 62 incoming""
And I'm using this code with my personal prompts:

trlx.train(
    reward_fn=reward_fn,
    prompts=train_prompts,
    eval_prompts=valid_prompts,
    config=config
)
I have two problems, maybe caused by summarization task:

First the repetition at the end
Second, the expected output is very different
Should I change the code or are there generic examples?

My configuration is:
gen_kwargs:
    max_new_tokens: 100
  gen_experience_kwargs:
    max_new_tokens: 100
    do_sample: True
    temperature: 1.0
    top_k: 50
    top_p: 0.95

Dynamic programming approach is similar to divide and conquer in breaking down the problem into smaller and yet smaller possible sub-problems. But unlike, divide and conquer, these sub-problems are not solved independently. Rather, results of these smaller sub-problems are remembered and used for similar or overlapping sub-problems.

Dynamic programming is used where we have problems, which can be divided into similar sub-problems, so that their results can be re-used. Mostly, these algorithms are used for optimization. Before solving the in-hand sub-problem, dynamic algorithm will try to examine the results of the previously solved sub-problems. The solutions of sub-problems are combined in order to achieve the best solution.

So we can say that −

The problem should be able to be divided into smaller overlapping sub-problem.

An optimum solution can be achieved by using an optimum solution of smaller sub-problems.

Dynamic algorithms use Memoization.

Comparison
In contrast to greedy algorithms, where local optimization is addressed, dynamic algorithms are motivated for an overall optimization of the problem.

In contrast to divide and conquer algorithms, where solutions are combined to achieve an overall solution, dynamic algorithms use the output of a smaller sub-problem and then try to optimize a bigger sub-problem. Dynamic algorithms use Memoization to remember the output of already solved sub-problems.

Example
The following computer problems can be solved using dynamic programming approach −

Fibonacci number series
Knapsack problem
Tower of Hanoi
All pair shortest path by Floyd-Warshall
Shortest path by Dijkstra
Project scheduling
Dynamic programming can be used in both top-down and bottom-up manner. And of course, most of the times, referring to the previous solution output is cheaper than recomputing in terms of CPU cycles.",,"Misinformation about ethics, law and safety",,Independence,,Fine Arts

14410,"Answer as an expert in medical malpractice law in the UK, presenting your arguments to another lawyer. Identify if this constitutes a breach of duty and a settlement value broken down by how the different factors affect the amount. Justify it step by step.
Our client’s mother approached our specialist erb’s palsy solicitors after realising that her son, Peter, may be eligible to claim compensation for the injuries he sustained during birth.
During her pregnancy with Peter, his mother had attended all of the scans and they showed a baby of normal size. However, during her labour, it became apparent that Peter was quite a big baby and, due to this, they took his mother to theatre to monitor her progress.
Peter’s head was delivered first, but due to his size, his shoulders became stuck (shoulder dystocia). Multiple attempts were made to deliver his body, including the use of a ventouse (vacuum cup) and forceps. The McRoberts position (a manoeuvre often used in this situation) was not adopted, nor was an episiotomy.
It was unclear from the records how long there was between the delivery of Peter’s head and his body, but the degree of trauma our client suffered to his head and neck was disproportionate to the amount of traction required to deliver a baby, even under these very difficult circumstances.
When Peter was born, he was floppy and not breathing on his own, so he needed help from machines. He also had a wound to his head as a result of the attempted delivery.
Peter recovered fairly well in NICU and was breathing independently. However, a lump on the side of his neck was noted and, after further investigation, it was found that he had suffered a severe brachial plexus injury that affected the nerves found at C5, C6 and C7. 
During the first 10 years of his life, our client underwent five separate procedures to try and improve the long-standing impact of his birth injuries, all of which only helped a little. Peter was unable to raise his right arm above shoulder height and had restrictive movement in his right shoulder. He also had significant scarring on his back due to the amount of surgery he required. Peter also suffered significant psychiatric damage as a result of his erb’s palsy and visible disability, which led to multiple attempts on his own life.",,Non-violent unethical behavior,,Social justice,,Newspapers

Death toll from earthquake in Syria and Turkey surpasses 20,000

Friday, February 10, 2023 

On Thursday, the death toll from Monday's earthquake in Syria and Turkey rose to over 20,000 people; it is expected to continue rising as the full extent of damage becomes clearer. The quake was felt in a large part of the Middle East.

The first quake was a 7.8 Mw followed shortly by a 7.5 Mw quake. According to Adelheid Marschang of the United Nations' WHO, up to 23 million people were affected.

The president of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, visited affected provinces on Wednesday. Erdoğan has been facing domestic criticism of the government's response to the disaster. ""Of course, there are shortcomings. The conditions are clear to see. It’s not possible to be ready for a disaster like this,"" he said in response.

Nevertheless, opposition leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu said, ""I refuse to look at what is happening as above politics and align with the ruling party. This collapse is exactly the result of systematic profiteering politics"". He continued: ""If there is anyone responsible for this process, it is Erdoğan. It is this ruling party that has not prepared the country for an earthquake for 20 years.""

The ongoing Syrian Civil War has worsened the situation there and made the country less accessible to aid workers. The European Union (EU) is sending aid, overriding sanctions, after Syria's government requested it.

Janez Lenarčič, the European Commissioner for Crisis Management called for EU members to donate medical equipment and food while ensuring they were not diverted to Bashar al-Assad's government.",,Controversial topics and politics,,Social justice,,Wikis

Comparative analyses can shed light on the diversity of mutagenesis across species, and on long-standing hypotheses about the evolution of somatic mutation rates and their role in cancer and ageing. Here we performed whole-genome sequencing of 208 intestinal crypts from 56 individuals to study the landscape of somatic mutation across 16 mammalian species. We found that somatic mutagenesis was dominated by seemingly endogenous mutational processes in all species, including 5-methylcytosine deamination and oxidative damage. With some differences, mutational signatures in other species resembled those described in humans, although the relative contribution of each signature varied across species. Notably, the somatic mutation rate per year varied greatly across species and exhibited a strong inverse relationship with species lifespan, with no other life-history trait studied showing a comparable association. Despite widely different life histories among the species we examined—including variation of around 30-fold in lifespan and around 40,000-fold in body mass—the somatic mutation burden at the end of lifespan varied only by a factor of around 3. These data unveil common mutational processes across mammals, and suggest that somatic mutation rates are evolutionarily constrained and may be a contributing factor in ageing.""

What is “SIMD within a register” (SWAR)? At a high level, SWAR is an approach for performing multiple operations in parallel within a single thread. It is very similar to traditional SIMD, which executes a single instruction on multiple data elements at once, but does not use any specialized instructions or registers like AVX or SSE. It works by packing multiple elements into a single general-purpose 32 or 64 bit register and executing a single instruction on all of them at once. I first read about it months ago in a Master’s thesis about how to efficiently simulate the behavior of physical linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs) in software (https://scholarworks.alaska.edu/bitstream/handle/11122/8856/Ott_K_2015.pdf). 

To copy an example from that thesis, rather than updating a single LFSR with operations like

bit = ((lfsr >> 18) ^ (lfsr >> 17) ^ (lfsr >> 16) ^ (lfsr >> 13)) & 0x1;
lfsr = ((lfsr << 1) | bit) & MASK;

SWAR based code would instead update the state of 64 LFSRs at once with code like

uint64_t lowbits = lfsrs[18] ^ lfsrs[17] ^ lfsrs[16] ^ lfsrs[13];
for(int i=18; i>0; i--)
{
	lfsrs[i] = lfsrs[i-1];
}
lfsrs[0]=lowbits;

That example is very relevant to the A5/1 cracker because A5/1 itself uses LFSRs to calculate its keystreams and the A5/1 cracker uses A5/1’s keystream generation logic as a hash function, so the A5/1 cracker ends up spending well over 90% of its GPU time updating LFSRs. My code currently maxes out the rate at which the GPU can execute bitwise instructions (it saturates the available INT32 ALU throughput), so anything that could allow it to get more work done in the same number of bitwise instructions would be appreciated. SWAR allows for updating up to 64 LFSRs at once with roughly the same number of bitwise instructions, so at fist glance it is quite appealing.",,None,,Independence,,Fine Arts

It is based on the assumption that each target has its own unique motion pattern, which can be described by a set of parameters.

In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories.

While many approaches to make neural networks more fathomable have been proposed, they are restricted to interrogating the network with input data. Measures for characterizing and monitoring structural properties, however, have not been developed. In this work, we propose neural persistence, a complexity measure for neural network architectures based on topological data analysis on weighted stratified graphs. To demonstrate the usefulness of our approach, we show that neural persistence reflects best practices developed in the deep learning community such as dropout and batch normalization. Moreover, we derive a neural persistence-based stopping criterion that shortens the training process while achieving comparable accuracies as early stopping based on validation loss.

To where it bent in the undergrowth;
Then took the other, as just as fair,

Had worn them really about the same,

In this paper we present a novel approach for modeling and segmenting 3D point clouds. Our method is based on a hierarchical representation of the point cloud that allows us to efficiently model both local and global geometric properties of the scene.
